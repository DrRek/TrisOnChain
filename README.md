# TrisOnChain
A smart contract example for tictactoe implementation on the Ethereum blockchain.
This can be published to one of the multiple testnet on Ethereum and used to play tictactoe. Originally made just to learn Blockchain and
understand it's really capabilities, this project is not meant for a real use. 

To make it work the easiest way is to publish the contract on a testnet blockchain, edit the address received in the javascript src and publish 
the front-end on a web server or in IPFS.
